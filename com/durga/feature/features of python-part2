*******Python features*******
1>simple and easy to learn
2>Freeware and open source
3>High level programming language
4>Platform independent
5>Portability
6>Dynamically Typed
7>Both procedure oriented and objected oriented
8>Interpreted
9>Extensible
10>Embedded
11>Extensive library

1>simple and easy to learn:
-concise(less) code, lenght of the code will be very less compare to other programming
-There are 33 reserved words
-python code is something like reading english statement
eg1;
x=(10>20)?30:40; //in java
x=30 if 10>30 else 40

eg2;
a=10
b=20
a is b

eg3;
if emp is not None

eg4;
print(open('abc.txt').read())

2>Freeware and open source:
PSF(python software foundation) is responsible to maintain python. Its a nonprofit organisation. Its website is python.org
Java11 version onward, its paid.
source code of python is open to everyone.
Jython is used to work with java application
Iron python is used to work with C#.Net application
Anaconda python is used to work with big data.

3>High level programming language:
->its programmer friendly not machine friendly language.We are not required to worry for low level activities like below,
-how the memory allocated?
-how the object will be destroyed?
-how the security will be there?
internally above activities taken care by PVM(python virtual machine)

4>Platform independent:
-python is platform independent, write python application once and run anywhere on any platform. We are just required to
 install PVM specific to platform. PVM is platform dependent. PVM is responsible to convert python application in
 platform specific form.

5>Portability:
-The process of migrating application from one platform to another platform is called portability.

6>Dynamically Typed:
-In python we are not required to declare type explicitly, based on provided value automatically type will be considered.
eg1;
a=10
print(type(a))//int

a="durga"
-for same variable in its life we can use for mutiple types in python.

7>Both procedure oriented and objected oriented:
->Python is all rounder.
python-
-procedure oriented
-OOP
-Scripting language
-Modular

8>Interpreted:
-We are not required to comile explicitly. It is interpreted by python virtual machine.

9>Extensible:
-We can use legacy non python code in python
-If somewhere in application performance is very critical, we can develop that functionality in C program and we can
start using that C code in python code. Biggest advantage of this approach is performance of the application.

10>Embedded:
->Extensible feature in reverse
->We can use python code in any other language application code. For eg; java app is there for a particular task if we
  want to use python, we can use jython version of python.

11>Extensive library:
->In python for every requirement, readymade library is available, lacs of libraries are there in python. No other
  programming language has this much library support.
->WAP to generate 6 digit OTP.
-we can use random library for this purpose.
eg;
from random import randint
print(randint(0,9))
